# Clip to Github

This webextension will upload the contents of your clipboard (and potentially more things in the future) to a GitHub repository of your choice. The contents of the clipboard are uploaded to a Markdown file in the chosen folder. The file's name is the current date in ISO format. You may choose whether the browser should immediately open that page.

## How to use

After installing the extension, click on the ðŸ“Ž button.
After that, click `Add new target` and fill in these fields:

- `GitHub user/repo`: this field contains a string formed of `[username]/[repoName]`. For example `valenting/clip_to_gh`.
- `Repository path`: this optional field contains a string with the path of a directory in your repo where files should be placed.
- `Github token`: this string contains an authentication token needed to upload files to the specified GitHub repo.
- `Open page after upload`: checking this box will open the github page in a new tab after a successful upload.

After filling in these fields click `Save Target`.

Clicking the button for that entry will then upload the contents of your clipboard to GitHub.

### Generating a token

You can either generate a general github token with the `repo` scope at [this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) or preferrably generate a fine grained token for `Only select repositories` with `Contents: read/write` permission for the specific repo you are targetting at [this link](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)

See the Github documentation page for more info:

## Roadmap

This is a personal project that may or may not end up getting maintained for long. However, there are some features I think may be useful.

- [x] Upload clipboard to GitHub.
- [ ] Convert rich text / HTML to markdown before uploading.
- [ ] Right click option to upload selection to GitHub without copying to clipboard.
- [ ] Option to edit contents before upload to GitHub.
- [ ] Better naming scheme for files. Provide a pattern that is filled in.
- [ ] Add ability to overwrite existing files.
